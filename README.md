being able to write and take notes to keep track of tasks and lists

# Description
with the use of installing all dependencies, I have learned how express.js works and with the use of localhost, it shows how to the website is developing. Also with the help and GET and POST requests to keep data sent and received , they will match the routes to the defined path. After installing all depencies, server.js allows us to see the localhost to keep track of web development.
